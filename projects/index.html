            </h3>
                <p>Generic Miner is, in my opinion, my best creation so far. Generic Miner is created using the Canvas API, pure JS, and some HTML too.

In Generic Miner, your goal is to make money off of mining in the 3 mines I currently have in the game. I'm planning on adding a lot more, but this game is in it's early stages.

Generic Miner is heavily inspired by a game on the App Store named Gold Mountain, so check it out if you like Generic Miner.

            </h3>
                <p>
                    Pure JavaScript Brick Breaker is a simple brick breaker I made in pure JavaScript, and render using the HTML Canvas API.

It's my first game made using Canvas, and it def isn't too good but I think it's good enough. 

I had to create entirely custom checkboxes and buttons for the home and settings page, because afaik, you can't use HTML buttons and checkboxes inside of a &lt;canvas &gt;.

The entire game is in 2 files, one HTML and one JS. You can visit the <a href="" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
                    repository to look at the code.

            </h3>
                <p>Everything Generator is a simple group generator I made for my German class. It also has a number generator, and a randomized default list of names. 

As mentioned before, I made it specifically for my German class. In fact, when I made it, my German teacher thought I was a hacker for making it. I'm apparently the ultimate master haxx0r for making a group generator... 
                
I used to use this as a way to send stuff between my skiovox account and my school account, but since I now use the 120 method(even though I'm on 118), I can have a school and skiovox window open at the same time.

            </h3>
                <p>Clicker Miner is a p web game I'm currently working on.

Clicker Miner, as the name suggests, is a game where you mine by clicking. You start out mining dirt, stone, and coal, but will build up to mining ores from other universes(examples include: Murdronium, Oblivium, Electrite, and everyting else past Unobtanium). I made up the majority of the extrauniversal ores, some of them referencing something(ex. Murdronium being a Murder Drones reference).

            </h3>
                <p>Idle Privacy is a web game I've stopped working on.

Idle Privacy was about privacy; as the name suggests. You click a button, get more privacy, and the cycle continues. It's simple and was my first attempt at a game. I've since stopped working on it, however.

            </h3>
                <p>HistTsunami was a simple website designed to help you flood your history, even with bookmarklets blocked.

HistTsunami worked by spam-opening tabs of the chosen URL with different hashes. If you chose to flood your history with "https://example.com" 5 times, it'd open "https://example.com/#1" through "https://example.com/#5".

            </h3>
                <p>R E T R O, unlike anything else here, is a level I've made in Geometry Dash.

R E T R O is a pretty simple level; being a black and green level that's always under a pixelation filter. I originally made R E T R O's layout as a joke, as I found the song I use, AlastReYn - The Amazing Digital Circus Main Theme (Chiptune Version), funny. However, I actually enjoyed playing the layout, so I decided to start decorating it. It isn't be rate-worthy, but I'm still proud of it as I like the way the decoration looks. I'm currently working on a sequel to this level.

R E T R O's ID is 99044552, if you want to play it.
